# EM and REM

- em is relative to the font size of the parent element
- rem is relative to the font size of the root (html) element

Use em when:

- You want sizes to scale relative to a parent element's font size
- Styling elements that should change size based on their context
- Creating components that need to adapt to their container

Use rem when:

- You want consistent sizing across the entire document
- Setting global styles like base font sizes, margins, and padding
- Avoiding compounding size changes in nested elements
- Creating a more predictable and maintainable layout
