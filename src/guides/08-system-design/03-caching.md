# Caching

## DNS (Domain Name System)

- Function: Stores resolved domain names to IP addresses, reducing the need for repeated DNS lookups.
- Benefits: Speeds up the process of accessing websites by allowing quicker retrieval of IP addresses that have been previously resolved.

## Client-Side Cache

- Function: Also known as browser caching, it stores data locally on the user's device after the first request.
- Benefits: Reduces server load and latency by allowing the browser to access cached files without contacting the server again13.

## CDN (Content Delivery Network)

- Function: Distributes cached content (like images and videos) across multiple geographically dispersed servers.
- Benefits: Improves access speed by serving content from a location closer to the user, thereby reducing latency13.

## Application

- Function: Caches data in memory on the application server using key/value stores.
- Benefits: Delivers rapid response times (sub-millisecond) and reduces database load, significantly enhancing throughput14.

## Database

- Function: Caches frequently accessed database queries and results.
- Benefits: Speeds up database interactions by storing results of common queries, thus reducing the need for repeated database access15.
