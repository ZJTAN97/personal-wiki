# Deep and Shallow Copy

Deep Copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and
disconnected from the original variable.

Shallow Copy means that certain sub-values are still connected to the original variable.

For Primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, undefined, null), if you make a copy, it will be a real copy.

For Composite data types (Objects, Arrays), it will result in shallow copy.
