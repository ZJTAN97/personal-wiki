title: Closures

Closure is when you have a function defined inside of another function, that inner function has access to the variables
and scope of the outer function even if the outer function finishes executing and those variables are no longer accessible
outside of that function.

- Closures from definition requires more memory and computation
- Use closures for data encapsulation

The closure has three scope chains 

1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
2. Outer funcion's variables
3. Global Variables

Example Code

```js
function Welcome(name){
  var greetingInfo = function(message){
   console.log(message+' '+name);
  }
return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome('John');
myFunction('Welcome '); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction('Hello Mr.'); //output: Hello Mr.John
```

As per the above code, the inner function `greetingInfo` has access to variables in outer function scope `Welcome`
even though the outer function has returned.
