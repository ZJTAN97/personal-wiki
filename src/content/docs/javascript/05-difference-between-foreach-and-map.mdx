title: Difference between .forEach and .map
---

## `forEach`

- Iterates through the elements in an array
- Executes a callback for each element.
- Does not return a value

## `map`

- Iterates through the elements in an array
- "Maps" each element to a new element by calling the function on each element, creating a new array as a result.

- The main difference is that `.map()` returns a new array while `.forEach` does not (returns undefined)
- If you simply need to iterate over an array, `forEach` is a fine choice
- If you need the result but do not wish to mutate the original array, `.map()` is the clear choice.
