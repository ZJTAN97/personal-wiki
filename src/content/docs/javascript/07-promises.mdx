title: Promises
---

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. Provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing cleaner code.

## Three states of promises

1. `Pending`. Initial state of the promise before an operation begins.
2. `Fufilled`. Indicates the specified operation was completed.
3. `Rejected`. Indicate operation did not complete, error value will be thrown.

## A promise must follow a specific set of rules,

1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method
2. A pending promise may transition into either fufilled or rejected state
3. A fufilled or rejected promise is settled must not transition into any other state.
4. Once a promise is settled, value must not change.

`promise.all`

- Takes an array of promises as as input (iterable) and gets resolved when all the promises get resolved
  or one of them gets rejected.

```js
Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3])
  .then(result) => {   console.log(result) })
  .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
```

`promise.race`

```js
var promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
});
var promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(value) {
  console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
});
```
