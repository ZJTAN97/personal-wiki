title: Web Workers
---

Web Workers are scripts that can run in the background.

This is their primary purpose: to execute JavaScript code in a separate thread, away from the main thread that handles the user interface. 
This allows for computationally intensive tasks to be performed without freezing or slowing down the user's interaction with the web page (developer.mozilla.org, wikipedia.org).


## Key Statements and Capabilities

Based on the provided search results, here are the true statements about Web Workers:

- **Web Workers enable scripts to run in a background thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application.** This prevents computationally expensive tasks from blocking the main thread, keeping the application responsive ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), [codemag.com](https://www.codemag.com/Article/2101071/Understanding-and-Using-Web-Workers)).

- **They cannot directly manipulate the DOM.** Web Workers operate in a separate context and do not have direct access to the browser's Document Object Model ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), [codemag.com](https://www.codemag.com/Article/2101071/Understanding-and-Using-Web-Workers), [loginradius.com](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/web-workers)).

- **Communication between Web Workers and the main thread happens via messages.** This is typically done using the `postMessage()` method and responding to `message` events ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), [codemag.com](https://www.codemag.com/Article/2101071/Understanding-and-Using-Web-Workers), [loginradius.com](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/web-workers)).

- **Data transferred between threads is copied, not shared directly.** This ensures that the threads remain isolated ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)).

- There are **different types of Web Workers**, including dedicated workers, shared workers, and service workers ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS/Introducing_workers)).

- **Workers can make network requests** using `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers)).

- **JavaScript's built-in asynchronous features (like Promises) do not achieve true multi-threading.** While they handle asynchronous operations like I/O, computationally expensive tasks can still block the main thread. Web Workers provide true parallel execution for such tasks ([loginradius.com](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/web-workers)).

- **They have limitations,** such as not being able to access `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` directly, and requiring careful management of error handling and complex workflows ([loginradius.com](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/web-workers)).

- **Workers can spawn other workers,** provided they are hosted within the same origin ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)).

- **Debugging Web Workers** can be done using browser developer tools, though the process might differ slightly from debugging regular scripts ([codemag.com](https://www.codemag.com/Article/2101071/Understanding-and-Using-Web-Workers)).
