title: Difference between a variable that is null, undefined and undeclared
---

## Undeclared

`Undeclared` variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using `var`, `let`, `const`.
such a variable is defined globally, outside of the current scope. In strict mode, a `ReferenceError` will be thrown when you try to assin
an undeclared variable. AVOID THIS.

## Undefined

`undefined` is a variable that is declared but not assigned a value. type of `undefined`.

## Null

`null` variables will have been explicitly assigned to the `null` value. It represents no value and is different from `undefined` in the
sense that it has been explicitly assigned. if you use `typeof(null)` will return `object`
