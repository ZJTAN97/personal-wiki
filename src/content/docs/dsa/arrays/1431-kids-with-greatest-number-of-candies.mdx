title: 1431. Kids with Greatest Number of Candies
---

import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Difficulty: <Badge text="EASY" variant="success" />

Problem description can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/description)

## Approach

One learning point or "recap" for me was to use `Math.max(...numArr)` to easily find the max number in an array of numbers
in JavaScript.

## Solution

```ts
function kidsWithCandies(candies: number[], extraCandies: number): boolean[] {
  const currentMax = Math.max(...candies);

  const output: boolean[] = [];
  for (const candy of candies) {
    if (candy + extraCandies >= currentMax) {
      output.push(true);
    } else {
      output.push(false);
    }
  }

  return output;
}
```
