Problem description can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/).

## Approach

Can follow a typical Backtracking problem template.

Somehow after doing a few backtracking problems, there are few things you can do to control the "decision making"
and iterating through said "decision making".

For this question's case since we are allowed to reuse variables, the backtracking step does not need to increase the index.

## Solution

```ts
function combinationSum(candidates: number[], target: number): number[][] {
  const result: number[][] = [];

  function backtrack(index: number, path: number[]) {
    const currentSum = path.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

    if (currentSum === target) {
      result.push(path.slice());
      return;
    }

    for (let i = index; i < candidates.length; i++) {
      path.push(candidates[i]);

      if (currentSum < target) {
        backtrack(i, path);
      }

      path.pop();
    }
  }

  backtrack(0, []);

  return result;
}

combinationSum([2, 3, 6, 7], 7); // [ [2, 2, 3], [7] ]
combinationSum([2, 3, 5], 8);
```
