title: 283. Move Zeroes

import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Difficulty: <Badge text="EASY" variant="success" />

Problem description can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/).

## Approach

Using two pointers, the right pointer constantly moves (as part of the for-loop index iteration).
The left pointer only increases when the current right pointer value is not zero.

Remember to think of the swap as just values swapping, not the pointers swapping!

## Solution

```ts
function moveZeroes(nums: number[]): void {
  let leftPointer = 0;
  let temp: number;

  for (let rightPointer = 0; rightPointer < nums.length; rightPointer++) {
    if (nums[rightPointer] !== 0) {
      temp = nums[leftPointer];
      nums[leftPointer] = nums[rightPointer];
      nums[rightPointer] = temp;

      leftPointer++;
    }
  }
}
```
