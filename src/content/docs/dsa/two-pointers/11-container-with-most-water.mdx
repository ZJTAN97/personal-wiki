## Approach

Two pointers.

We can solve this problem using the two-pointer approach:

1. Start with two pointers, one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the height array.
2. Calculate the area between the two pointers: the width is the difference between the indices of left and right, and the height is the smaller of the two values at height[left] and height[right].
3. Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward:
   - If the line at left is shorter, increment left to potentially find a taller line.
   - If the line at right is shorter, decrement right to potentially find a taller line.
4. Continue this until the two pointers meet, updating the maximum area at each step.

The final result will be the largest area found during this process.

## Solution

```ts
function maxArea(height: number[]): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = height.length - 1;
  let result = 0;

  while (left !== right) {
    result = Math.max(
      result,
      (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right])
    );

    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }

  console.log(result);

  return result;
}

maxArea([1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]); // 49
maxArea([1, 2, 1]); // 2
```
