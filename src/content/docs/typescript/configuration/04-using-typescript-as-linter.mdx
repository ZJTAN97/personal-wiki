title: Using TypeScript as a Linter
---

The noEmit option is how we'll tell TypeScript to behave more like a linter. When set to true,
this option prevents TypeScript from generating JavaScript output files when you run tsc:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": true
  }
}
```

By setting noEmit to true, you prevent TypeScript from generating unnecessary JavaScript files, while still benefiting from TypeScript's type checking.

It's also worth noting that the noEmit option makes certain other settings in the tsconfig.json redundant.
For instance, the outDir option, which specifies the output directory for the emitted JavaScript files, becomes meaningless when noEmit is set to true.
