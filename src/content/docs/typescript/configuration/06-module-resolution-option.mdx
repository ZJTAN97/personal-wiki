title: The moduleResolution Option
---

## Module and Module moduleResolution

The `module` setting in TypeScript specifies the kind of module code you want TypeScript to emit.

The `moduleResolution` option determines how TypeScript should resolve imports throughout your application.

## The only options that matter

If you're transpiling your code with TypeScript, you should choose `module: NodeNext` and `moduleResolution: NodeNext`.

If you're using another transpiler, you should choose `module: ESNext` and `moduleResolution: Bundler`.

## The `NodeNext` Setting

When setting module and moduleResolution both to "NodeNext", TypeScript will want you to add a .js extension to local file imports.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
// inside tsconfig.json
"compilerOptions": {
  "module": "NodeNext",
  "moduleResolution": "NodeNext"
...
}
```

This might seem strange as you're importing a .ts file, but it's because TypeScript targets the compiled JavaScript file, not the TypeScript source file. 
TypeScript never wants to change runtime behavior by altering import paths, hence the need for a .js extension.

## The `ESNext` and `Bundler` Settings

This configuration is more flexible with extensions and is handled by the bundler.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
// inside tsconfig.json
"compilerOptions": {
  "module": "ESNext",
  "moduleResolution": "Bundler"
  ...
}
```

In general, if you're working on the front-end with a framework like Vite or Next.js, you'll likely want moduleResolution: Bundler.
