title: Understanding how TypeScript works in your IDE

## Overview

When you open VS Code, the TypeScript server starts in the background. It's kind of like a second set of eyes looking at your code.

For every change you make, the TypeScript server will check your code. If it sees any errors with that code, it tells VS Code to show a red line.

After you fix the error, it will check again and confirm the fix, and the red line will disappear. The TypeScript server also powers other features in VS Code, such as autocomplete and hovers.

The TypeScript server is active as long as VS Code is open, and won't stop until you quit the application.
