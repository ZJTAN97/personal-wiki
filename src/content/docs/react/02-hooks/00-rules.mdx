title: Rules of Hook in React
---

React Hooks follow two primary rules that ensure stateful logic stays predictable across renders.

## 1. Only Call Hooks at the Top Level

You must always call Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.

- No Loops or Conditions: Do not call Hooks inside if statements, for loops, or nested functions.
- Consistent Order: React relies on the order in which Hooks are called to associate state with the correct Hook between renders. If a Hook call is skipped due to a condition, the order shifts, causing bugs or crashes.
- The Solution: If you need an effect or state to be conditional, put the condition inside the Hook (e.g., `useEffect(() => { if (condition) { ... } }))` rather than wrapping the Hook in the condition.

## 2. Only Call Hooks from React Functions

Hooks are not regular JavaScript functions; they can only be used in specific contexts:

- Function Components: Call Hooks within the body of a React function component.
- Custom Hooks: Call Hooks inside other custom Hooks.
- Invalid Locations: Do not call Hooks in regular JavaScript functions, class components, event handlers, or inside functions passed to useMemo or useEffect.
