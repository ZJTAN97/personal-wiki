## Overview

The `<base>` element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLS in a document.

There can only be one `<base>` element in a document.

A document's used base URL can be accessed by scripts with Node.baseURI. If the document has no `<base>` elements,
then baseURI defaults to location.href.

:::danger
Warning: A `<base>` element must have an href attribute, a target attribute, or both. 
If at least one of these attributes are specified, 
the `<base>` element must come before other elements with attribute values that are URLs, such as a `<link>`'s href attribute.

## Why would we use it?

The `<base>` tag specifies a default base URL or target for all relative URLs in an HTML document. 
It’s typically placed in the `<head>` section and applies to elements like `<a>`, `<img>`, `<script>`, and `<link>` that use relative paths. 
Think of it as a way to avoid repeating the same domain or folder path across your codebase.

```html title="example.html"
<head>
  <base href="https://example.com/blog/">
</head>
<body>
  <a href="article.html">Read Article</a> <!-- Resolves to https://example.com/blog/article.html -->
  <img src="cover.jpg" alt="Cover"> <!-- Resolves to https://example.com/blog/cover.jpg -->
</body>
```

Useful for the following scenarios

- Simplify Relative URLs: Instead of writing https://example.com/assets/images/photo.jpg, you can use photo.jpg and let `<base>` handle the rest.
- Ease Migrations: Moving a site to a new domain? Update the `<base>` tag instead of rewriting every link.
- Consistency: Ensure all relative links resolve correctly, even in deeply nested folders.

## What happens if `<base>` is missing?

If no `<base>` tag is present, relative URLs resolve against the document’s current URL, accessible via location.href in the browser. 
Scripts can also check the base URL using Node.baseURI, which defaults to location.href when `<base>` is absent.
