title: Difference between Inline and Block Element
---

In HTML, the primary difference between inline and block elements is how they occupy space and affect the flow of a webpage's layout.

## Block Level Elements

These elements act as structural boxes that stack vertically.

- **Behavior**: They create a visible break before and after themselves, pushing subsequent content to the next line.

- **Examples**:
  - `<div>`
  - `<p>`
  - `h1` to `h6`
  - `ul`, `ol`, `li` (Lists)
  - `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` (Semantic Regions)

## Inline Elements

These elements act as "presentational" markers that flow with the text.

- **Behavior**: They appear side-by-side on the same line if there is space.

- **Examples**:
  - `<span>` (Generic Container for text)
  - `<a>` (Hyperlink)
  - `<strong>` and `<em>` (Emphasis)
  - `<img>` (Image)
  - `<button>` and `<input>` (UI components)

## Inline-Block Hybrid

You can use the CSS display property to set an element to display: inline-block. 
This allows the element to flow side-by-side like an inline element while still respecting width, height, and vertical spacing like a block element.
